					<li data-theme="d">The novel details the life story of a middle-aged black woman by the name of Janie Crawford. 
					Janie was born shortly after slavery ended in the south after her mother was raped. The traumatic experience and 
					difficulty of raising a child causes Janie's mother, Leafy, to run away leaving Janie to be raised by her grandmother, 
					Nanny. Throughout Janie's childhood and teen years Nanny spends much of her time trying to raise her in the best way 
					she sees possible even marrying her off in hopes that Janie's new husband will provide her with security. 
					Janie's first marriage with a man by the name of Logan Killicks is very unsuccessful as Logan sees Janie as 
					nothing more than help around his home; the two share no mutual feelings of love. The troubled relationship 
					pushes Janie away and she falls in love with another man, Jody Stark, and the two run away together. 
					Jody proves to be a very determined and well-rounded man, and when the two arrive in the town of Eatonville 
					and take residence Jody establishes his place in the community right away. Jody helps the town blossom by 
					starting a general store and later becoming the town mayor. This relationship is also very disappointing 
					for Janie as well as she begins to realize that her role in the relationship is as Jody's trophy wife and 
					her husband shelters her. Ultimately just like her first marriage this one comes to an end as well, however 
					this time because of Jody's death.Once free of Jody, Janie is again able to start over, this time with the 
					added wealth and security left behind by her husband. Janie eventually meets a new man who is known as Tea Cake 
					and the two begin a romantic relationship. The two move to the Everglades and get married and enjoy an up and 
					down relationship for a few years before their lives take a tragic turn due to a hurricane. A hurricane ravages Florida, 
					and though Janie and Tea Cake both survive the hurricane, tragedy is soon to unfold. Following the storm a rabid dog bites 
					Tea Cake giving him rabies. In his delusions he attempts to kill Janie, however she kills him first by shooting him. 
					She is initially charged with murder and is put on trial only to be acquitted soon after. Following the trial and Tea Cake's 
					funeral Janie moves back to Eatonville to settle down, however she finds the town much less welcoming than before.
