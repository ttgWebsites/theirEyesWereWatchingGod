					<li data-theme="b">Explain Janie's initial attraction to Jody and the reasons why it doesn't last.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When Janie first meets Jody she is struggling with a difficult marriage to Logan Killicks.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She is unsatisfied with her life and longs for something greater.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jody's ambitions seem to offer the type of lifestyle Janie dreams about as at the time she also still slightly believes her grandmother's philosophy that wealth and security are a means to happiness.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jody also presents Janie with the unknown, he is unsure of where his path will lead him, but he has desires, this seems to excite Janie and she latches on to him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">After marrying Jody and settling into a new life with him she sees that a marriage with him is not what she dreamed it to be.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jody is very controlling of her and Janie is treated as more of a pawn in his dreams rather than a wife.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Janie realizes that though she longed for something more with Logan Killicks, Jody does not offer what she had dreamt of.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">As Janie begins to develop as a woman she begins to recognize that Jody is a terrible husband and that she deserves better.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">His death comes at an opportune time for Janie as she is still young enough to strive for the love she always desired.</li>

					<li data-theme="b">What does the title of the book show the reader and how does the specific title relate to Janie's path throughout the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When looking at the title of the book 'Their Eyes Were Watching God' it is interesting to note that the first word is plural.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Being that 'Their' is used rather than 'Her' shows that though the novel follows Janie's quest as a developing woman it follows more than just that.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is a story about her development and how it coincides with community and her partners.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The title comes from a scene in the novel when Janie, Tea Cake, and Motor Boat look on at the looming hurricane.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Looking at the hurricane is in a way similar to looking into the eyes of God as the hurricane is on the verge of permanently altering all three of their lives.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Each of the characters has a different path as a result of the hurricane.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Tea Cake's brashness and belief that he can weather the hurricane ultimately comes back to haunt him as he is attacked by a rabid dog, and succumbs to the horrors of rabies.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Janie on the other hand gains wisdom and strength as a woman from the hurricane.</li>
